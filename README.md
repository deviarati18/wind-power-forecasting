The work emphasizes on improving the prediction accuracy and determining whether using any of the measured data below the hub height is sufficient to accurately predict wind power generation at the hub, lowering the cost of wind data measurements. Two-year wind power generation data from the SCADA system corresponding to two selected wind farms in China are used for training, validation, and testing the four machine learning models (such as decision tree, extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and gradient boosted regression trees). The outcomes pointed out that the measurement data corresponding to 30 m yielded wind power generation results that are comparable to the hub. The findings suggested that the random forest model resulted in more accurate predictions for both low and high wind speed values, while decision tree had the least performance accuracy at any wind speed range.
